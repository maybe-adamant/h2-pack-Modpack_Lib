# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Storage declarations now use direct flat `alias` identifiers as the canonical managed storage backing keys.
- Removed old `configKey`, `lifetime`, and `runtime` storage declaration compatibility in favor of explicit `persist`, `stage`, and `hash` axes.
- Lib now injects `Enabled` and `DebugMode` as built-in prepared storage aliases instead of requiring module-authored config defaults.
- Module definitions now require both stable `id` and display `name`; `modpack` remains optional.
- Module callbacks receive the author host consistently: `registerHooks(host, store)`, `registerIntegrations(host, store)`, `registerOverlays(overlays, host, store)`, `registerPatchMutation(plan, host, store)`, `onSettingsCommitted(host, store, commit)`, `drawTab(imgui, session, host)`, and `drawQuickContent(imgui, session, host)`.
- Module authors now construct through `lib.createModule(...)` / `lib.tryCreateModule(...)` and activate through `host.tryActivate()`; lower-level definition/state/host construction is internal.
- Host activation now stages and commits hooks, integrations, overlays, and mutation sync through host-owned receipts, so omitted registrations are removed on reload and activation failures roll back candidate effects.
- `lib.hooks.Override(...)` now accepts function replacements only, matching the host-owned dispatcher model.
- Retired separate internal lifecycle design notes; accepted lifecycle tradeoffs now live in `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`.
- Persistent runtime-cache module state is now declared with `stage = false, hash = false`, read through `store.read(...)`, and written through `store.writeUnstaged(...)`.
- Added first-class table storage roots with row-scoped aliases, staged table handles, read-only store table handles, packed child row access, and hash/profile serialization.
- Table storage handles use colon method syntax, such as `tiers:read(rowIndex, alias)`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added `lib.prepareDefinition(...)` as the canonical definition-preparation step before store and host creation.
- Added a LuaLS public definition file at `src/def.lua` for the Lib module export, storage/session types, module host contract, lifecycle helpers, mutation plans, widgets, nav, hooks, integrations, hashing, logging, and ImGui helpers.
- Added Lib-owned live-host publication and lookup through `lib.getLiveModuleHost(...)`.
- Added reload-stable ModUtil hook registration through `lib.hooks.Wrap(...)`, `lib.hooks.Override(...)`, and `lib.hooks.Context.Wrap(...)`.
- Added coordinated pack rebuild callbacks through `lib.coordinator.registerRebuild(...)` and `lib.coordinator.requestRebuild(...)`.
- Added optional cross-module integration registration through `lib.integrations.*`.
- Added `lib.imguiHelpers.*` enum/value helpers for low-level ImGui binding use.
- Added `lib.overlays.*` retained HUD overlay helpers with managed `middleRightStack` layout, stacked text, stacked rows, and framework/module/debug order bands.
- Added token-based `lib.overlays.suppressForUi()` overlay suppression for foreground ImGui configuration windows.
- Added `lib.gameObject.*` helpers for namespaced runtime state attached to live game object tables.
- Added runtime-only persisted storage aliases through `runtime = true` plus `store.getRuntimeState()`.
- Added `definition.onSettingsCommitted(host, store, commit)` as a post-commit observer for rebuilding derived runtime/UI structures after staged config commits and staged session actions.
- Added docs for hot-reload architecture and known limitations under `docs/`.
- Added player-facing `THUNDERSTORE_README.md` packaging support.

### Changed

- Module authoring now uses the explicit `prepareDefinition(...) -> createModuleState(...) -> createModuleHost(...)` flow.
- Effective storage defaults are hydrated during definition preparation, before structural fingerprinting.
- Structural definition changes are fingerprinted separately from behavior-only changes.
- Coordinated modules can request a Framework rebuild when structural definition shape changes during hot reload.
- `createModuleHost(...)` now owns live-host publication and requires `drawTab`.
- Public module host surface was narrowed around stable host accessors and behavior calls; direct raw definition access was removed.
- `createModuleHost(...)` and `standaloneHost(...)` now require an explicit plugin guid captured at module load time.
- Manual lifecycle hooks now receive the active author host and managed store as `apply(host, store)` and `revert(host, store)`.
- Mutation lifecycle state is tracked by stable module identity where available, making reload/reapply behavior more robust.
- Host startup sync now reverts active tracked mutation state when a module reloads disabled.
- Store creation now requires prepared definitions with explicit storage.
- Runtime-only storage aliases are excluded from session staging, profile/hash surfaces, and reset-to-defaults flows.
- Host `writeAndFlush(...)` and `flush()` now notify `onSettingsCommitted` after successful dirty commits.
- The fallback HUD marker now participates in the shared overlay layout instead of owning a separate HUD placement path.
- Standalone module UI now suppresses Lib overlays while open and restores them on close after pending runtime flushes.
- Internal helper duplication was consolidated into shared internal value/store utilities.
- Widget packed dropdown/radio helpers avoid repeated packed-choice classification work per frame.
- Long-form guides and reference docs now live under `docs/`.
- Packaged README content moved out of `src/README.md`; package metadata now points at `THUNDERSTORE_README.md`.

### Fixed

- Fixed standalone/coordinated checks to read persistent coordinator state instead of transient captured tables.
- Fixed fallback HUD marker hook registration so it no longer stacks raw ModUtil wraps across reloads.
- Fixed manual mutation lifecycle paths so manual `apply`/`revert` receive the store consistently.
- Fixed storage default fingerprinting so config default changes are part of the structural contract.
- Fixed string hash serialization by escaping reserved token characters inside persisted keys and values.
- Fixed rebuild-request handling so rejected coordinator rebuild callbacks are not reported as successful.

### Documentation

- Expanded `API.md` to describe the current public Lib surface.
- Updated module authoring docs around prepared definitions, Lib-owned host publication, standalone hosting, lifecycle behavior, hooks, integrations, widgets, and hash helpers.
- Updated hot-reload docs around author-facing module reload support and infrastructure reload limitations.
- Moved known limitations into Lib docs so shared modpack constraints have one home.

### Tests

- Expanded test coverage for prepared definitions, lifecycle validation, stores/sessions, hooks, hashing, logging, mutation plans, nav, widgets, integrations, standalone hosting, and host publication.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

Initial public release of the adamant Modpack Lib surface.

### Added

- managed module storage through `lib.createModuleState(config, definition)`
- explicit staged UI state through the returned `session`
- host-based module wiring through `lib.createModuleHost(...)`
- standalone window/menu hosting through `lib.standaloneHost(...)`
- coordinator helpers under `lib.coordinator.*`
- mutation helpers under `lib.mutation.*`
- hashing and packed-bit helpers under `lib.hashing.*`
- immediate-mode widget helpers under `lib.widgets.*`
- immediate-mode navigation helpers under `lib.nav.*`
- managed storage support for:
  - `bool`
  - `int`
  - `string`
  - `packedInt`
- transactional session commit/resync support for host and framework flows
- coordinated-pack enable-state support through `lib.coordinator.isRegistered(...)` and `host.isEnabled()`
- standalone and framework-friendly module authoring contract based on:
  - `public.definition`
  - `public.host`
  - direct draw functions such as `DrawTab(imgui, session, host)`

### Notes

- this release documents the current immediate-mode Lib contract
- legacy declarative UI authoring is not part of the supported public surface for this release
