# Hot Reload Architecture

This document describes the supported hot-reload model of the adamant stack.

It covers how `adamant-ModpackLib`, `adamant-ModpackFramework`, coordinator shells, and coordinated modules stay coherent when files reload inside one live Hades II process.

For the raw behavior of `SGG_Modding-ReLoad`, `SGG_Modding-ModUtil`, and `SGG_Modding-Chalk`, read [RELOAD_MODUTIL_CHALK_REFERENCE.md](RELOAD_MODUTIL_CHALK_REFERENCE.md) first.

## Goals

- keep normal player sessions safe without requiring code edits
- support module development with live module reloads
- support Lib and Framework development without leaving the stack on stale hosts or stale callbacks
- keep ownership of reload-sensitive responsibilities explicit

## Process Model

Hot reload reruns Lua files inside the live game process.

Important consequences:
- a full game process restart clears mod globals, wrapper chains, and reload state
- loading a save, starting a run, or returning to title is not a full process restart
- persistent module globals survive when code reuses them with `X = X or {}`

The stack relies on that persistence for stable internal registries.

## Layer Responsibilities

### Core

Core owns coordinator bootstrap and stable GUI callback registration.

Core responsibilities:
- register stable `rom.gui` callbacks once behind `modutil.once_loaded.game(...)`
- call `Framework.init(...)` from the reload body
- late-read Framework factories so a Framework reload does not leave Core holding stale closures

### Framework

Framework owns pack-level coordinator state:
- discovery
- hashing
- HUD
- coordinator UI

Framework also owns pack freshness checks:
- it stores the init params used to build each pack session
- it rebuilds a pack when Framework itself reloads
- it does not rebuild a pack for ordinary coordinated module behavior reloads

### Lib

Lib owns the shared reload-sensitive plumbing:
- coordinator registration
- coordinated module startup/runtime sync
- stable ModUtil hook dispatch
- mutation runtime persistence
- standalone host suppression for coordinated modules

### Modules

Modules own their local rebuild:
- recreate `definition`, `store`, `session`, and `public.host` in `init`
- keep `chalk`, `reload`, and raw config local to `main.lua`
- keep persisted runtime reads on `store`
- keep staged UI edits on the author-facing `session`
- declare runtime hooks from `internal.RegisterHooks()`

## Bootstrap Pattern

The steady-state plugin pattern is:

```lua
local loader = reload.auto_single()

local function registerGui()
    rom.gui.add_imgui(renderWindow)
    rom.gui.add_always_draw_imgui(alwaysDraw)
    rom.gui.add_to_menu_bar(addMenuBar)
end

local function init()
    -- rebuild current state
end

modutil.once_loaded.game(function()
    loader.load(registerGui, init)
end)
```

The important part is the split:
- stable GUI registration happens once
- the active state rebuild happens from `init`

## Coordinated Module Host Refresh

`lib.createModuleHost(...)` is the behavior refresh boundary for a coordinated module.

When host creation succeeds:
- the module host closes over the current `definition`, `store`, and `session`
- if `hookOwner` and `registerHooks` are provided, Lib refreshes that owner's hook registrations
- if the coordinator for `definition.modpack` is already registered, Lib immediately runs `host.applyOnLoad()`

That means one coordinated module reload refreshes its live runtime behavior immediately without forcing a pack rebuild.

## Framework Pack Refresh

Framework stores two things per pack session:
- `initParams`
- `frameworkGeneration`

Its renderer, menu-bar callback, and always-draw callback all run a freshness check before using the pack.

Framework rebuilds the pack when:
- Framework reloaded and its generation changed

The rebuild path reruns `Framework.init(pack.initParams)` and refreshes discovery, HUD, hash, and UI state from the latest framework surfaces.

## Hook Model

Raw ModUtil path hooks do not deduplicate. The stack solves that through `lib.hooks`.

Supported public hook entrypoints:
- `lib.hooks.Wrap`
- `lib.hooks.Override`
- `lib.hooks.Context.Wrap`

The model is:
- use a persistent owner table, typically the module `internal`
- register hook sites from `internal.RegisterHooks()`
- pass `hookOwner` and `registerHooks` into `lib.createModuleHost(...)`
- Lib runs the full registration pass during host creation

Behavior:
- the same owner/path/key updates the live handler instead of stacking another wrapper
- function overrides dispatch through a stable wrapper
- omitted wrap and context-wrap registrations become inert
- omitted override registrations are restored

This keeps hot-reloaded logic live without accumulating normal duplicate wrappers.

### Hook Caveat

There is one accepted development-only caveat.

If the same wrap or context-wrap site is:
- removed
- hot reloaded
- re-added
- hot reloaded again

within one live game process, inert wrappers can accumulate for that path.

This is:
- dev-only
- functionally safe
- cleared by a full game process restart

The stack does not currently engineer around that case.

## Mutation Model

Mutation runtime is persisted on `AdamantModpackLib_Internal`, not on recreated store objects.

Important properties:
- active tracked mutation state survives store recreation
- active state is keyed by stable module identity when available
- `applyOnLoad` synchronizes live mutation state to the module's effective enabled state
- if a module is disabled on reload, tracked active mutation state is reverted

This keeps run-data patch lifecycles coherent across reloads.

## Coordinator And Standalone Behavior

Coordinator metadata is persisted on `AdamantModpackLib_Internal.coordinators`.

Important consequences:
- a Lib reload does not forget which packs are coordinated
- standalone module windows remain suppressed for coordinated modules
- standalone startup lifecycle applies only when the module is not coordinated

Framework calls `applyOnLoad()` for discovered coordinated modules during pack init.
`lib.standaloneHost(...)` calls `applyOnLoad()` for standalone modules during standalone startup.
`lib.createModuleHost(...)` also calls `applyOnLoad()` immediately when the module is already coordinated, so behavior-only module reloads resync live runtime state without a pack rebuild.

## Safety By Scenario

### Normal player use

Safe.

Players who are not editing files do not exercise the hot-reload path. The stack boots from scratch and uses the same runtime contracts without reload churn.

### Developer doing module work

Supported.

Module reload replaces the module's live host surface. Framework snapshots that host on the next UI/hash operation, and Lib immediately resyncs live mutation state if the module is already coordinated.

### Developer doing Lib or Framework work

Supported.

Persistent Lib registries survive Lib reload. Core late-reads Framework callbacks. Framework rebuilds pack state when its generation changes.

### Developer reloading Lib and modules in one session

Supported.

The coordinator registry, mutation runtime, and Framework freshness checks are designed to converge back to the latest live surfaces.

### Structural edits

Not hot-reload resilient by design.

Changes to:
- `definition.id`
- `definition.modpack`
- `definition.name` or `shortName`
- `definition.storage`
- `definition.hashGroups`
- module presence or discovery shape

should be handled by a full reload.

## Practical Rules

- keep `chalk`, `reload`, and raw config local to `main.lua`
- recreate `definition`, `store`, `session`, and `public.host` in `init`
- keep `session` local to `main.lua`; draw callbacks receive the restricted author session through the host
- register runtime hooks through `internal.RegisterHooks()` and `lib.hooks.*`
- pass `hookOwner` and `registerHooks` to `lib.createModuleHost(...)` when the module owns runtime hooks
- keep stable GUI callbacks outside `init`
- late-read current framework or module state from those stable callbacks when a stale closure would matter
- do not use raw ModUtil path wraps for repo-owned hot-reload-sensitive hook sites
- do not replace persistent internal registries on reload; update their contents instead
