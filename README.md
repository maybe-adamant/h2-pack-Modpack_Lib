# adamant-ModpackLib

Reusable runtime library for Hades II mod authors building modpacks, large
configuration-heavy mods, or coordinated feature bundles.

ModpackLib provides the common plumbing that those projects usually need:

- typed storage definitions for module settings
- a staged UI `session` model for responsive ImGui config screens
- a persistent `store` model for runtime hook logic
- profile and hash helpers for saving, loading, and identifying settings
- mutation helpers for modules that patch run data
- module host helpers for coordinated and fallback UI usage
- reusable ImGui widgets and navigation helpers

The library is designed around immediate-mode UI. Module authors write normal
draw functions, then expose them through a module host:

```lua
local data = import("mods/data.lua")
local logic = import("mods/logic.lua").bind(data)
local ui = import("mods/ui.lua").bind(data)

local host, store = lib.createModule({
    pluginGuid = PLUGIN_GUID,
    config = config,
    id = "ExampleModule",
    name = "Example Module",
    storage = data.buildStorage(),
    drawTab = ui.drawTab,
    drawQuickContent = ui.drawQuickContent,
})
logic.registerHooks(host, store)
host.tryActivate()
```

`pluginGuid` is the stable runtime identity; Lib owns the internal hot-reload
state for hooks, overlays, integrations, game cache, mutation runtime, and
structural reload tracking. Declare runtime hooks on `host.hooks.*` before activation.
`host.tryActivate()` registers the live host for coordinated discovery and installs requested fallback UI.
Every module definition must declare a stable `id` and display `name`; `modpack`
is optional and marks modules that participate in Framework coordination.

## Public Surface

- `host.hooks`
- `host.overlays`
- `host.integrations`
- `host.gameCache`
- `host.fallbackUi`
- `lib.imguiHelpers`
- `lib.widgets`
- `lib.nav`

Common top-level helpers:
- `lib.createModule(...)`
- `lib.tryCreateModule(...)`
- `lib.createFrameworkRuntime(...)`

Most authors start with `lib.createModule(...)`.
Pack orchestrators that should skip invalid modules instead of stopping sibling
modules can use `lib.tryCreateModule(...)` plus `host.tryActivate()`.
See [docs/module-authors/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/module-authors/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the recommended project shape.

## Validation

```bash
cd adamant-ModpackLib
lua52.exe tests/all.lua
```
